# exoplanet_transits

In this project we analyze data from NASAâ€™s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), 
which was launched in April 2018. The data files contain time-series data for two stars
with transiting exoplanets.

A transit occurs when a planet passes between a star and its observer.

During its initial 2-year survey mission, TESS has used its 
array of wide-field cameras to monitor 200 000 of the brightest stars near the Earth to look 
for small dips in the light from the star that correspond to (exo)planets transiting the face of 
the star and blocking some of the light.
